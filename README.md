# Relative-Entropy Endpoint-Path Gaps as a Diagnostic of RG Coarse-Graining Failure

This repository hosts the compiled PDF and the LaTeX source package for the worked one-loop QED computation paper.

The paper introduces endpoint/path gap diagnostics—(i) a strict path gap and (ii) a domain-gated computable geometric proxy—for identifying coarse-graining failure along RG flows under a fixed viewpoint/resolution.

## Current release

- **v1.3.0 (Final / camera-ready)**  
  Symbol/notation normalization, added pseudocode and reporting protocol details, and expanded figures/tables for reproducibility.  
  Prior releases (v1.0–v1.2) remain available and citable (each has its own DOI), but may contain draft-level notation inconsistencies.

## Contents

- `Relative_Entropy_Endpoint_Path_Gaps_as_a_Diagnostic_of_RG_Coarse_Graining_Failure.pdf`  
  Compiled manuscript (**current release: v1.3.0**).

- `Relative_Entropy_Endpoint_Path_Gaps_as_a_Diagnostic_of_RG_Coarse_Graining_Failure.zip`  
  LaTeX source package corresponding to the PDF (**v1.3.0**).
