# Relative-Entropy Endpoint-Path Gaps as a Diagnostic of RG Coarse-Graining Failure

This repository hosts the PDF and the LaTeX source package for the worked one-loop QED computation paper.  
The paper introduces endpoint/path gap diagnostics (strict path gap and a computable geometric proxy) for identifying coarse-graining failure along RG flows under a fixed viewpoint/resolution.
